    Simplifies ingredients to pantry items (e.g., "1 cup shredded cheddar" â†’ "Cheese").

    Removes units, preparation instructions, and duplicates.

    Uses OpenAI for semantic simplification.

âœ… Notion Integration

    Uploads recipe data to a Notion database.

    Links pantry items to recipes.

    Adds new pantry items if not already in the database.
