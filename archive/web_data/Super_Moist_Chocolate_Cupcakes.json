        "¼ cup + 2 Tbsp cocoa powder (38g)",
        "¾ tsp Edmonds Baking Soda",

        "1 egg",
        "½ cup Meadow Fresh Milk (125ml)",
        "¼ cup Olivani Pure Olive Oil (60ml)",
        "1 tsp vanilla",
        "½ cup boiling water (125ml)",

    ],
    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 180Â°C conventional or 160ÂºC fan-forced. Line a 12-hole muffin tray with paper cases. Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl, then add the sugars and stir in. Add the egg, Meadow Fresh Milk, Olivani Pure Olive Oil and vanilla then beat with a mixer until combined. Scrape the sides of the bowl then add the boiling water and mix until just combined (the batter will be runny). Pour the batter into a measuring cup or jug (itâ€™s easier and cleaner than using a spoon) and pour evenly into each paper case until Â¾ filled (donâ€™t over fill or the mixture will overflow). Place in the oven and bake for 20-22 minutes or until a tester inserted in the centre comes out clean. Berry Icing Mix icing sugar with hot water. Add Tararua Butter and beat until light and fluffy. Pipe or spread onto muffins.",
